<h2 align="left">About</h2>

Introducing! The newest soldering workshop developed for the Schulich School of Engineering Makermultipliex and Zetta, the new Voltage Sniffing Rex!

Created as a cool educational toy and NOT as a replacement or alternative to a REAL electrical tester, the Voltage Sniffing Rex can detect and react to live wires containing AC voltages.

This prototype aims to introduce beginners to basic through-hole soldering techniques and safety in a new and interactive way. The contents of this repo should provide 
all the files necessary to produce these dinos for yourself.

For more information about equipment, trainings and classes offered within the Makermultiplex visit https://schulich.libguides.com/m2z/.
And for more cool dino themed project kits, checkout the Flex-E Rex Soldering Kit here https://github.com/Lee-F-Evans/Flex-E-Rex-Soldering-Kit

<h2 align="left">Gathering Parts</h2>

To create the kits you'll need to order some PCBS, gather all the nessassary parts listed in the BOM excel sheet, and grab some basic soldering tools.

<h2 align="left">PCB Fabrication</h2>

The repo above should include both KiCad project files should you feel like viewing or modifying them, and also ready made gerbers and image reference files (TBA) that can be used directly for PCB manufacturing.

The PCB's were order from PCBWay as they provide full UV colour printing onto PCB's using simple image files and some extra silkscren work when designing the PCB. 

* Of note as of writing this, other manufacturers such as JLC PCB do also provide full colour printing, but require you to use their own deisgn software for it to work, as such unless this changes I reccomended using PCBWay as your main board manufacturer.

<h2 align="left">Parts</h2>

The provided bill of materials or BOM provided above, details all the nessassary parts required for this kit. The BOM along with listing parts, also links Digi-Key part listings should you wish to order them from them, though ordering the parts from any vendor should also work.
<h4 align="left">Part Substitutions</h4>

* A note on the 555 timer ic, the LMC555 timer spcificed in the BOM does have a standard pinout so feel free to change the chip out for any numerious different versions of the 555 chip, though it MUST be able to operate at atleast 3V preferably below and share the same standard pinout.

* A note on the LM358 op-amp ic, again this 8-pin duel op-amp ic has a standard pinout, so feel free to change out the chip for any number of duel op-amp, 8-pin, standard pinout ics that operate at preferably below 3v.

<h2 align="left">Tools</h2>

You'll only need the basic tools to solder for this this kit including,
* Soldering Iron
* Lead-Free Solder
* Flush Cutters / Wire Cutters

And Thats it!
